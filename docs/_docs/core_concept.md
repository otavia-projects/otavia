## Challenges of existing programming paradigm

As Moore's Law fades and the size of modern software systems grows exponentially, single-core CPUs and even standalone
computers are no longer enough to meet our needs. In order to meet this challenge, modern software systems not only need
to work well with multi-core CPUs on a single machine, but also need to run on multiple computers in a distributed
manner. These challenges are seriously impacting the current mainstream programming paradigm and making the current
mainstream programming languages evolve in new directions.

The first is asynchronous programming, but the combination of the object-oriented programming paradigm and asynchronous
programming often produces callback hell. This approach destroys object-oriented encapsulation and also makes the code
logic more diffuse, making it less maintainable.

The second is that functional programming has become more popular, and now basically all major programming languages
support some functional features. Functional programming presents a beautiful vision: everything is immutable! This
makes writing code like defining a mathematical function; once the function is defined, every time it is called, as long
as the input is the same then the output is the same, and there is no behavior beyond that. This programming paradigm is
a wonderful idea, and code written in this way is not only secure but also easier to test and the behavior of the code
is more controllable. But functional programming has some drawbacks: it's not easy to deal with state, and a real
software system often needs to deal with a lot of state, IO, and so on. Although functional programming also has
techniques such as `Monad` and `Effect` to deal with these scenarios, these techniques are too complex and expensive for
many developers to learn. Remember that famous quote?
> A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?

Meanwhile, there is an old programming paradigm that seems to be better suited to the complexity of modern, highly
concurrent, distributed software systems: the Actor model, proposed in 1973. But the Actor model also has some
drawbacks, which is perhaps why it has not become as popular as object-oriented programming.

`otavia` is an Actor programming model implemented in `Scala 3`. We hope to explore a way to integrate the Actor model
more effectively with modern programming languages, and also to explore ways to address some of the shortcomings of the
traditional Actor model. The following article provides an overview of the core concepts and design of `otavia`.

## Design principles of otavia

Object-oriented programming is a very useful programming paradigm, and while the original object-oriented idea was
somewhat similar to the Actor model, where an object is equivalent to an Actor, modern implementations of
object-oriented in the major programming languages have degraded it to a way of organizing and encapsulating the code,
since the cost of calling methods directly is much less than message passing. This is wonderful in the single-threaded
case, where everything is organized.

But the crisis came with multithreading and multiple CPU cores: multithreading is like a herd of savage bulls rampaging
through a fragile jungle of objects! Instead of having a single path of execution, programs are now controlled by a
well-organized set of objects. Instead, you need to care carefully whether each object will be accessed by more than one
thread at the same time, and you need to double-check your program's concurrency safety. But it's not easy to do.
Especially for a software system of enormous size, you don't know how many threads are rushing through your jungle of
objects, so you need to go out and simulate every thread with a human brain, track their paths, and then figure out
which objects should need to deal with concurrency safety. Imagine tracking down this herd of savage bulls in the
jungle, meticulously checking one by one which grasses they've stepped on! God, it's maddening to think about. All this
work was already exhausting, but there was an even more serious problem: these bulls would suddenly come to a standstill
when they stepped on certain grass! They are blocked and thus suspended, and this reduces the system's CPU utilization,
which in turn may lead to the launching of more threads, with more and more concurrent contention, until the system
crashes under a concurrency problem that is not rigorously examined!

Happily, new technologies have emerged to solve these problems. The most popular technical solutions are coroutine
and JVM virtual threads. However, in our opinion, these techniques are effective in alleviating the problem of
low CPU utilization due to suspended threads, but they do not alleviate the problem of having to carefully design our
objects due to concurrency competition.

The main reason the problem has gotten so bad we believe is that the current mainstream programming languages and
object-oriented programming paradigms are missing some of their key features! That is, the lack of organization of
concurrency and the lack of organization of execution flow! Concurrency and execution flow are currently coupled with
objects, which was not a problem in early single-threaded environments, but becomes very serious in multi-threaded,
multi-CPU environments!

Organizing concurrency and execution flow is where the Actor model excels! With the advent of `Scala 3`, we saw the
possibility of designing an Actor programming tool that was more in line with object-oriented thinking. So, after a long
period of conceptualization, I designed `otavia` and its associated toolkit. The goal is to explore a simpler and safer
programming paradigm to meet the current challenges. Also hope to open up a new idea to provide everyone to promote the
development of programming tools!

We believe that a better programming hierarchy would look like the following, and the design of `otavia` follows this
hierarchy

**System > Process > Threads > Virtual Threads/Stacked coroutines > `Actor > Objects > Functions`**

In this hierarchical design, the Actor is the end point of concurrency, i.e., the Actor and its subsequent parts should
all run single-threaded! Actors communicate with each other by sending messages, and multiple messages are processed one
by one in the Actor's mailbox in a single-threaded fashion.The logic inside the Actor can be either object-oriented or
functional, or even a combination of them, as in `Scala`! Now everything is simple again and you can boldly use objects
without worrying about that wild herd of bulls!

## Core Runtime

The basic unit for managing concurrency in `otavia` is the `Actor`, the user only needs to implement various
customized `Actors` and then send messages between the `Actors` to achieve the overall system functionality. However,
the ideal `Actor` programming model is not easy to achieve, because real programming scenarios involve not only the
interaction of components inside the program, but also the interaction with other components outside the system, which
in turn involves IO programming and even timed tasks. To meet these needs, `otavia` adds some new components to the
Actor model. The core components that make up the `otavia` runtime are:

- `Actor`: An `Actor` is the basic unit of concurrency in `otavia` and it has two basic subclasses. An `Actor`
  communicates with each other by sending messages. An `Actor` can also interact with other components of
  the `ActorSystem` by way of `Event`. The types of `Event` are fixed and cannot be customized by the developer.
    * `StateActor`: a normal `Actor`.
    * `ChannelsActor`: `Actor` for handling IO.
- `ActorSystem`: A container for `Actor` instances that is responsible for creating `Actor` instances, managing the life
  cycle of `Actor` instances, and scheduling the execution of `Actor` instances.
- `Timer`: Generates a timed event, generates a timeout `Event` and sends it to the relevant `Actor`.
- `Reactor`: Processes IO commands submitted by the `ChannelsActor`, listens for IO events, handles IO reads and writes,
  and sends the IO results to the `ChannelsActor` as an `Event`.
- `Address`: `Actor` instances are isolated from each other and can only communicate with each other by sending messages
  via `Address`.
- `Message`: Used to communicate between `Actors`, there are three basic types of messages: `Notice`, `Reply`,
  and `Ask[R <: Reply]`, and user-defined messages must inherit one or more of these.

![](../_assets/images/programming_model.drawio.svg)

To program with `otavia`, the user must first start an instance of `ActorSystem`, which represents the `otavia` runtime.
The `ActorSystem` contains the thread pool that schedules the `Actor` instance to run, the `Timer` component, and
the `Reactor` component. Next the user simply starts their own `Actor` instance using `ActorSystem`. The `ActorSystem`
returns the `Address` of the corresponding `Actor` instance to the caller. Next, the user can send messages to
the `Actor` via this `Address`. Unlike object-oriented method calls, sending a message does not directly execute the
logic that processes the message; instead, it puts the message into the `Actor`'s mailbox and waits for it to be
processed. Once the `Actor` has a message in its mailbox that can be processed, the `ActorSystem` schedules an idle
thread to execute the `Actor` instance.

![](../_assets/images/actor_instance.drawio.svg)

Another condition for an `Actor` instance to get thread execution is to receive an `Event`, which is also put in the
`Actor` mailbox for processing. In `otavia`, events can only be generated by `Timer` and `Reactor`, and users only need
to care about `TimerEvent` generated by `Timer` when programming. The processing of `ReactorEvent` produced by `Reactor`
is further encapsulated by `ChannelsActor`.

## Event

An `Event` is the basic unit of interaction between an `Actor` and the `ActorSystem` runtime, and its type is fixed and
cannot be customized by the developer. There are two main types of `Event`s

- `TimerEvent` : Generated by `Timer` to notify a timeout event. Only `TimeoutEvent` is used directly in programming.
  The remaining `TimerEvent`s are used to support other timeout mechanisms and are encapsulated by `Actor`.
- `ReactorEvent`: Generated by `Reactor` to notify an IO event. Developer does not need to deal with this `Event`
  directly, it is encapsulated by `ChannelsActor`.

The `ActorSystem` runtime sends an `Event` to the `Actor` instance and does not call the `Actor` instance directly;
instead, it puts the `Event` into the `Actor` instance's mailbox, and the `ActorSystem` runtime allocates free threads
to dispatch the `Actor` instance for execution.

## Message model

A message is a special object used by `Actor` for communication, and it is recommended that it be defined using
the `case class`. `otavia` categorizes the types of messages according to their usage in order to ensure compile-time
safety in message sending.

![](../_assets/images/message_types.drawio.svg)

According to the purpose of the message, `otavia` divides the messages into two types, the `Call` message is a request
message which is used to ask the `Actor` for an execution process and expects a reply message. A `Reply` message is a
reply message. It's kind of like a method abstraction. Let's see how we define a method. First, we need to give the
method a name, then we need to define the parameters of the method, and then we need to define the type of the return
value of the method. In `otavia`, `Call` represents the method name and method parameters, and `Reply` represents the
return value type. Since sending a message is more expensive than calling a method, `Call` is simplified to `Notice`
in `otavia` for the case where the method has a return type of `Unit`, and the case where a return value is required is
specialized to `Ask[R <: Reply]`, where a `Notice` message does not need to return a `Reply` message, as in the case of
A method with a return value of `Unit` has no actual return value.

![](../_assets/images/message_model.drawio.svg)

An `Ask` is a trait with a type parameter `R <: Reply` that specifies the type of the specific `Reply` message that
this `Ask` message expects to get. So an `Actor` in `otavia` can be compile-time type-safe for sending messages by
simply constraining the types of `Call` messages it can receive via the type parameter. The type parameter of `Actor`
is:

```scala
trait Actor[+M <: Call] 
```

When creating an instance of `Actor` using `otavia`, it does not return the instance itself, but rather the `Address`
that represents the instance, with the type parameter of `Address` being the same as that of `Actor`.

```scala
trait Address[-M <: Call]
```

So we can only send messages of type `M` to `Address` which is limited by `Actor`. The `Reply` message is sent via
the `return` method of `Stack`, which is associated with the type of the `Call` message, so sending a `Reply` message is
also compile-time type-safe. We'll talk more about `Stack` later.

## Actor

There are two basic types of `Actor` in `otavia`, `StateActor` and `ChannelsActor`, and developers can choose to inherit
from one of them according to their needs.

![](../_assets/images/two_types_actor.drawio.svg)

`StateActor`: A generic `Actor` that developers can implement to manage state and send and receive messages.
This `Actor` can also interact with a `Timer` to register a timeout event. When the timeout event is triggered,
the `Timer` sends a `TimeoutEvent` to the `StateActor`, and then the `ActorSystem` schedules the `StateActor` to execute
to handle the `TimeoutEvent`.

`ChannelsActor`: Based on the functionality of `StateActor`, we have added the ability to manage `Channel`s. `Channels`
in `otavia` are ported from Netty, and are basically the same as Netty. However, unlike Netty, `Channel` in `otavia`
must be bound to a `ChannelsActor` and run as part of the `ChannelsActor`.

For ease of use, `otavia` abstracts the following common `Actor`s according to different scenarios, and you can choose
to inherit one of them to fulfill your needs:

![](../_assets/images/actor_type.drawio.svg)

### Stack

`Stack` is the carrier that manages the execution of messages in `Actor`. When an `Actor` handles a message of
type `Call`, the message is not passed in directly, but is loaded into a `Stack` which is then passed to the `Actor` for
execution. A `Notice` message is loaded into a `NoticeStack` that executes the `resumeNotice` method; an `Ask` message
is loaded into an `AskStack` that executes the `resumeAsk` method. A developer implementation of `Actor` needs to
implement the following methods to handle `Call` messages.

```scala
protected def resumeAsk(stack: AskStack[M & Ask[? <: Reply]]): StackYield

protected def resumeNotice(stack: NoticeStack[M & Notice]): StackYield
```

`Stack` contains a `StackState` with an initial value of `stackstate.start`. The return value of the `resumeXXX`
method `StackYield` means that Stack switches to a new `StackState` after each resumeXXX execution. `Stack`
ends with the `return` method, which itself returns a value of `None`, meaning that `Stack` no longer switches to the
new `StackState`. If `Stack` is `AskStack`, the `return` method requires an input `Reply` message as a reply to
the `Ask` message.

![](../_assets/images/stack_resume.drawio.svg)

A `StackState` must be associated with one or more `Future`s. When the `resumable` method of the `StackState`
returns `true` or all associated `Future`s are completed, `resumeXXX` will be called again to execute the `Stack`.
Note that the `Future` here is not a `Future` from the `Scala` standard library; `otavia` implements its
own `Future/Promise` system for receiving asynchronous messages and triggering the re-execution of `Stacks`.

#### Types of Stack

Different messages have different `Stack` subclasses.

- `NoticeStack`: Manages the execution of `Notice` messages.
- `AskStack`: Manages the execution of `Ask` messages.
- `BatchNoticeStack`: Used to batch execute `Notice` messages.
- `BatchAskStack`: Used to batch execute `Ask` messages.
- `ChannelStack`: Executes requests sent by `Channel`.

**Developer-defined messages may inherit both the `Notice` and `Ask` traits, and whether they end up being treated
as `Notice` messages or `Ask` messages depends on how the message was sent:
If it is sent using the `notice` method of `Address`, it is treated as a `Notice` message; if it is sent by the `ask`
method, it is treated as an `Ask` message.**

#### Types of Future

A `Future` is a receiver for an asynchronous message, and whenever a `Future` completes, the `StackState` associated
with it is checked to see if the conditions for execution are met. Once satisfied, the `resumeXXX` method is called
again to execute the `Stack`. There are two types of `Future`s according to their purpose.

- `MessageFuture`: Used to receive a `Reply` message or a `TimeoutReply` message generated due to a timeout.
- `ChannelFuture`: Get the result of a `Channel` execution or a message from a `Channel`.

#### Zero-cost abstraction

Although we use `Stack`, `Future`, etc. to manage the execution of messages, we don't have to worry about the system
sending too many messages and creating too many extra objects that will put a strain on the GC. Because these objects
are created by the `otavia` runtime and are managed by the object pool, object reuse is maximized. Also,
developer-implemented `StackState` can use the pool if it is used by a high frequency. `otavia` provides a very simple
way to use the object pool. You can refer to the
[FutureState](https://github.com/otavia-projects/otavia/blob/main/core/src/cc/otavia/core/stack/helper/FutureState.scala)
implementation to learn how to use object pooling.

#### Advantages of using Stack to manage message execution

By using `Stack` to manage the execution of messages, we can manage dependencies between messages very well, and sending
a message is more like calling a method of an object directly. Going further, we can even implement a set
of `async/await` syntax based on the CPS (Continuation Passing Style) using `Scala 3` metaprogramming tools. This is the
goal of the project [otavia-async](https://github.com/otavia-projects/otavia-async). If you are interested in this
project, you are more than welcome to contribute!

### Kinds of ChannelsActor

In order to better manage different `Channel`s, `otavia` implements several different kinds of `ChannelsActor`, they
are:

- `AcceptorActor`: manages the `Channel` that listens for TCP connections, which needs to instantiate a set
  of `AcceptedWorkerActor`s as working `Actor`s. Normal `Channel`s that are accepted by the listening `Channel` are
  wrapped in a message and sent to one of the `AcceptedWorkerActor`s, and managed by the selected `AcceptedWorkerActor`.
- `AcceptedWorkerActor`: The working `Actor` for the `AcceptorActor`.
- `SocketChannelsActor`: manages the TCP client `Channel`.
- `DatagramChannelsActor`: manages the UDP `Channel`.

All of these types of `ChannelsActor` can manage file `Channel`, and if you only need to use file `Channel`, you can
just inherit `ChannelsActor`.

### Life cycle of an Actor

The entire life cycle of an `Actor` is managed by the `otavia` runtime. When `ActorSystem` creates an `Actor` object, it
immediately returns the `Address` of the `Actor` object to the caller. At the same time, the `Actor` object is placed in
a mount queue waiting to be mounted to `ActorSystem`. Only after the `Actor` object is mounted, the runtime schedules
the `Actor` to process the `Message` or `Event` in the mailbox. Runtime-related properties are set when the `Actor`
object is mounted, so runtime-related properties within the `Actor` can only be used after the object is mounted, such
as `logger`, `context`, and so on. `Actor` provides some hook methods for running at different lifecycles.

- `afterMount`: Called after the `Actor` object is mounted to `ActorSystem`.
- `beforeRestart`: Called before reboot.
- `restart`: Methods for restarting `Actor` instances.
- `afterRestart`: Called after a reboot.
- `AutoCleanable.cleaner`: If your implementation of `Actor` needs to clean up some unsafe resources, inherit
  the `AutoCleanable` trait and implement the `cleaner` method.

Although the life cycle of `Actor` instances is managed by `ActorSystem`, their destruction is still handled by the
JVM's garbage collection. If an `Actor` instance is no longer referenced by any GC root object, it is garbage collected
by the JVM. If your `Actor` has some unsafe resources that cannot be garbage collected by the JVM, you can
extend `AutoCleanable` and implement the `cleaner` method. The `cleaner` method creates a custom `ActorCleaner` object
to clean up the unsafe resources. Because `ActorCleaner` relies on the JVM's phantom references to identify `Actor`s
that will be garbage collected, you need to be careful when implementing `ActorCleaner` to ensure that it doesn't hold a
reference to the `Actor` object or the address of the `Actor` or the `Actor` will never be garbage collected.

The following figure shows the complete lifecycle of an `Actor`:

![](../_assets/images/actor_life_cycle.drawio.svg)

## Channel

In `otavia`, a `Channel` represents an IO object, such as an open file, a network connection, and so on. Since `Channel`
is ported from Netty, the basic components are similar to Netty, such
as `ChannelPipeline` `ChannelHandler` `ChannelHandlerContext`, etc., and work in the same way as Netty.

![](../_assets/images/architecture_of_channel.drawio.svg)

But there are also some adjustments that need to be made in order for `Channel` to work better with
`otavia`'s `ChannelsActor`:

1. Netty's `Channel` needs to be registered to `EventLoop` after it is created. The `EventLoop` is a thread that listens
   for IO events and then schedules the associated `Channel` for execution. Similarly for outbound calls on `Channel`,
   they need to be converted into tasks to be submitted to the `EventLoop` thread for queuing. There is no `EventLoop`
   component in `otavia`. The `Channel` in `otavia` needs to be mounted on a `ChannelsActor` after it has been
   successfully created, and then the `ChannelsActor` will register the `UnsafeChannel` of the `Channel` with
   the `Reactor`. The `Reactor` listens for IO events on the associated `Channel` and generates a `ReactorEvent` to send
   to the `ChannelsActor`. When the `ChannelsActor` is scheduled for execution, it assigns the `ReactorEvent` to the
   relevant `Channel` to execute the inbound process.
2. Netty's `EventLoop` not only listens to IO events, but also schedules the relevant `Channel` to execute when an IO
   event occurs, and the listening to IO, reading and writing of IO data, and execution of the `ChannelPipeline` are all
   in the same `EventLoop` thread. However, in `otavia`, listening to IO, reading and writing IO data are handled
   by `Reactor`, and then the related `ReactorEvent` is generated and sent to `ChannelsActor`, which is responsible for
   scheduling the execution of `ChannelPipeline`.
3. All business logic in Netty must be encapsulated into a `ChannelHandler` and then placed into a `ChannelPipeline`. If
   an inbound event reaches the end of the `ChannelPipeline` and the `TailHandler` still hasn't processed it, then Netty
   ignores it. However, inbound events in `otavia` that reach the `TailHandler` continue on to the `Inflight` component
   within the `Channel`, which is then distributed by `Inflight` to the `Stack` within the `ChannelsActor` for
   processing. In fact, the role of the `ChannelPipeline` in `otavia` is more focused on byte-sequence conversion and
   encoding, such as TLS, compression, serialization and deserialization of data objects, etc. Other complex business
   logic is handled directly by passing deserialized objects to the `Inflight` component of the `Channel`, which is then
   passed to the `ChannelsActor` for further processing.

### Channel Behavioral Abstractions

We abstract the behavior of `Channel` through two data structures:

`ChannelFuture`, which is a subclass of `Future`, so it can be managed by `StackState` of `Stack`, which we introduced
earlier. A `ChannelFuture` makes a request to a `Channel` on behalf of a `ChannelsActor` and expects to get a reply from
the `Channel`, which can be either an IO-ready event or a specific message (e.g., send an HTTP request, get an HTTP
response using a `ChannelFuture`). Usage of `ChannelFuture` is restricted to `ChannelAddress`. The `ChannelAddress` is a
kind of encapsulation for more standardized use of `Channel`. Inside the `ChannelsActor`, except for some special
methods that can access `Channel` directly, the rest of the access to `Channel` can only be done through
the `ChannelAddress`; The other data structure is the `ChannelStack`, this kind of data structure is `ChannelStack`.

The other data structure is `ChannelStack`, an object that makes a request on behalf of the `Channel` to
our `ChannelsActor`. This is a very common scenario when writing a web server program, for example, a `Channel` receives
an HTTP request and pass it to a `ChannelsActor` for specific business processing. This HTTP request is put into
a `ChannelStack` object and sent to the `ChannelsActor` for processing. A `ChannelStack` is a `Stack` whose return value
is written to a `ChannelPipeline` in response to an external program.

Note that the `ChannelFuture` datatype is also available in Netty, but it is used differently in `Netty` than it is
in `otavia`! Each call to the outbound method of `Channel` in Netty is associated with a `ChannelFuture`, but
this `ChannelFuture` is used to get the result of the call itself. If you want to make a request to `Channel` and expect
a data reply from the network, you need to get it some other way. But the `ChannelFuture` in `otavia` is
a higher level abstraction that represents the expected data response to a network request!

### ChannelPipeline

The `ChannelPipeline` is basically the same as the `ChannelPipeline` in Netty, with `HeadHandler` and `TailHandler` as
the first and last nodes, respectively. When the `Channel` is initialized, the user can add a custom `ChannelHandler` to
the `ChannelPipeline` via `Channel`. Like Netty, `ChannelHandler` is wrapped by `ChannelHandlerContext`, which then
concatenates all `ChannelHandler`s into a queue for sequential execution.

A `ReactorEvent` sent by a `Reactor` to a `ChannelsActor` triggers an inbound event for the `ChannelPipeline`. inbound
events are passed from the `HeadHandler` to the `TailHandler`. Calls to the outbound-related methods of the `Channel`
trigger outbound events from the `TailHandler` to the `HeadHandler`. outbound events arrive at the `HeadHandler` and are
ultimately converted into commands that are submitted to the `Reactor`.

![](../_assets/images/pipeline.drawio.svg)

### Channel Inflight

The `Inflight` is not a real component, it is just a representation of some of the data structures and mechanisms in
the `Channel`. Users don't need to interact with them directly, they just need to set some properties through
the `setOption` method of the `Channel` to control their behavior.

```scala
// source code in AbstractChannel
// outbound futures which is write to channel and wait channel reply
private val inflightFutures: QueueMap[ChannelPromise] = new QueueMap[ChannelPromise]()
// outbound futures which is waiting channel to send
private val pendingFutures: QueueMap[ChannelPromise] = new QueueMap[ChannelPromise]()
// inbound stack which is running by actor
private val inflightStacks: QueueMap[ChannelStack[?]] = new QueueMap[ChannelStack[?]]()
// inbound stack to wait actor running
private val pendingStacks: QueueMap[ChannelStack[?]] = new QueueMap[ChannelStack[?]]()
```

![](../_assets/images/channel_inflight.drawio.svg)

`Inflight` is an abstraction of the control of sending packets for network communication. How do we typically use a
network connection? In most cases, we send a request packet and wait for the response packet to be returned. Until the
response packet is returned, we can't send another request packet over the network connection. But this is an
inefficient use of the network connection, so there are many application layer protocols that support sending multiple
request packets over a single network connection, such as the pipeline mechanism in HTTP 1.1, the pipeline mechanism in
redis, and so on. However, due to the complexity of implementing these mechanisms, many applications do not support this
type of optimization.

In `otavia`, however, the powerful `Inflight` mechanism makes it very easy to do this! Now that we know
what `ChannelFuture` and `ChannelStack` are used for in `Channel`, the pipeline optimization mentioned above can simply
be understood as a single `Channel` handling multiple `ChannelFuture`s or `ChannelStacks`s at the same time. There are
several components in `Channel` that support this efficient use of network connections:

- `inflightFutures`: A `ChannelFuture` that has gone into the `ChannelPipeline` for processing.
- `pendingFutures`: A `ChannelFuture` that is still queued for processing into the `ChannelPipeline`.
- `inflightStacks`: A `ChannelStack` that has gone into a `ChannelsActor` for execution.
- `pendingStacks`: A `ChannelStack` that is still queuing up to enter the `ChannelsActor` for execution.

You can control the behavior of these components to adapt to different ways of working with network connections
through `setOption`:

- `CHANNEL_FUTURE_BARRIER`: A function of type `AnyRef => Boolean` that checks whether the request value of
  a `ChannelFuture` is a barrier, and if a request is a barrier, it must wait for the `inflightFutures` to finish
  processing before it can enter the `inflightFutures`. At the same time, `inflightFutures` can only process
  one `ChannelFuture` when processing a barrier, and can only continue to process the `ChannelFuture`
  in `pendingFutures` when it finishes. The default value is `_ => false`.
- `CHANNEL_STACK_BARRIER`: Used to set a function of type `AnyRef => Boolean` to check if the request value of
  a `ChannelStack` is a barrier, and if a request is a barrier then it must wait for the `inflightStacks` to finish
  processing before it can enter the `inflightStacks`. Also `inflightStacks` can only process one `ChannelStack` when
  processing a barrier, and can only continue to process `ChannelStacks` in `pendingStacks` when processing is complete.
  The default value is `_ => true`.
- `CHANNEL_MAX_FUTURE_INFLIGHT`: The maximum number of `ChannelFutures` that `inflightFutures` can process at the same
  time. When the maximum number is reached, new `ChannelFutures` are added to the `pendingFutures` queue and wait to be
  added to `inflightFutures`. The default value is 1.
- `CHANNEL_MAX_STACK_INFLIGHT`: The maximum number of `ChannelStacks` that `inflightStacks` can process at the same
  time. When the maximum number is reached, new `ChannelStacks` are added to the `pendingStacks` queue waiting to
  enter `inflightStacks`. The default value is 1.
- `CHANNEL_STACK_HEAD_OF_LINE`: Used to set whether the `Channel` processing `ChannelStack` is line head blocking.
  When `inflightStacks` have multiple `ChannelStacks` entering the `ChannelsActor` at the same time, the later
  initiated `ChannelStack` may finish earlier than the first initiated `ChannelStack`. When head blocking is set, the
  later completed `ChannelStacks` cannot directly execute the subsequent `ChannelPipeline`, but have to wait for the
  completion of all the `ChannelStacks` that were initiated first before they can be executed. The default value
  is `false`.

Setting these values in combination will result in more correct and efficient use of network connection resources in
different scenarios!

## Reactor

The `Reactor` is the component in `otavia` that performs unsafe IO work and is transparent to the user
of `otavia`. `Reactor` is responsible for receiving IO commands from `ChannelsActor` and generating the
associated `ReactorEvent` to send to `ChannelsActor`. However, this is all encapsulated by `ChannelsActor` and most
users don't need to worry about `Reactor`. The specific tasks of `Reactor` are to execute IO commands submitted
by `ChannelsActor`, listen for IO events, read and write IO data, and send `ReactorEvent` to `ChannelsActor`.

The default `Reactor` in `otavia` is based on NIO. However, since `Reactor` uses the SPI mechanism to implement the IO
transport layer, we can also extend the relevant interfaces to use more advanced IO techniques such as epoll, io_uring,
and so on, to realize a more high-performance IO transport layer. Since this is an SPI implementation, replacing another
IO transport layer implementation will not affect the business code we write at all, we just need to include the
relevant JAR in our CLASSPATH when we run the program. The goal of
the [native-transport](https://github.com/otavia-projects/native-transport) project in
the [otavia ecosystem](https://github.com/otavia-projects) is to implement a higher-performance IO transport layer based
on epoll and io_uring! If you are interested, your contributions are warmly welcomed!

## Timer

All timeout related functionality in `otavia` is supported by `Timer`. The `Timer` is one of the core components of
the `otavia` runtime, and provides APIs that allow developers to register a timeout event trigger. When the trigger
condition is met, `Timer` generates a `TimerEvent` and sends it to the registered address. The underlying implementation
of `Timer` is ported from `HashedWheelTimer` in Netty.

## Actor Dependency Injection

`Scala 3` provides a powerful [Match Types](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/new-types/match-types.html)
mechanism, which allows us to succinctly inject an `Actor`'s `Address` through the `Actor`'s type, and this behavior is
compile-time type-safe!

## Other core modules in the ecosystem

`otavia` contains an extensive ecosystem beyond the core runtime. The following describes the design goals for only some
of the modules that are more closely related to the core. For other modules you can check out
the [otavia ecosystem](https://github.com/otavia-projects).

### CPS transformation

The execution of a `Call` message in `otavia` requires a `Stack` to be started, and then the entire `Call` message
execution lifecycle is managed by the `Stack`. So the `resumeXXX` method implemented by the developer needs to match
the `StackState` execution and return a new `StackState`. Because the pattern is relatively fixed, we can use
the `Scala 3` metaprogramming tools to implement a set of `async/await` syntaxes based on CPS transformations, which
allows us to write code in a continuously blocking style.

### Buffer

Like `Channel`, `Buffer` is ported from Netty. Since `Channel` has to deal with a lot of byte-sequence conversion,
serialization and deserialization, the `Buffer` API is a must. Currently, `Buffer` just keeps the API basically the same
as Netty, and its implementation as well as the implementation of the memory pool has been greatly simplified.

Another inconsistency with Netty is that `otavia` removes `CompositeBuffer` and instead `otavia`
introduces `AdaptiveBuffer`.

An `AdaptiveBuffer` is a special kind of `Buffer` that can be infinitely scalable and burned later.
Because `AdaptiveBuffer` has a `BufferAllocator` associated with it, it automatically allocates some memory when it runs
out of space, and if the data is read, the read memory is automatically freed to the `BufferAllocator`. `AdaptiveBuffer`
is a data structure that is heavily used in `Channel`. IO data received from the `Reactor` is written to
the `AdaptiveBuffer` before being passed to the `ChannelPipeline`. At the same time, the `Channel`'s `write` also ends
up writing data to the `AdaptiveBuffer`, sending the bytes of data inside the `AdaptiveBuffer` to the `Reactor` to write
to the IO object via the `flush` method.

### codec

The `codec` module provides some common abstract classes for `ChannelHandler`, and developers can choose to inherit one
of them according to their needs. `otavia` categorizes `ChannelHandler` according to its position in
the `ChannelPipeline` and its function.

- `Byte2ByteXXcoder`: Used for conversion of byte sequences, where the input and output are byte sequences, such as TLS,
  compression, etc.
- `Byte2MessageDecoder`: Used for object deserialization where the input is a sequence of bytes and the output is a data
  object.
- `Message2ByteEncoder`: Used for object serialization where the input is a data object and the output is a sequence of
  bytes.
- `Message2MessageXXcoder`: Object conversions, where both input and output are objects.

These types of `ChannelHandler`s in the `ChannelPipeline` are not required and can be combined by the developer
according to their needs.

In addition to this, the `codec` module provides some tool classes and implementations of the
completed `ChannelHandler`, such as Base64, compression, and so on.

### Serialization Deserialization Framework

`Serde` expects to provide a unified interface for all serialization and deserialization tools. Since most serialization
deserialization frameworks in the current Scala ecosystem basically serialize to `java.nio.ByteBuffer` or `Array[Byte]`,
they don't work well with `otavia`'s `Buffer` (which involves multiple memory copies and doesn't easily take advantage
of the memory pool). So `otavia` introduced the `Serde[T]` interface, which uses `Buffer` as the basic serialization
deserialization target. So serialization frameworks based on `Serde` implementations can work efficiently
with `AdaptiveBuffer`, avoiding unnecessary memory copies and utilizing the memory pool directly. At the same time,
developers can also extend `Buffer`, such as the file-based implementation of `Buffer`, to serialize objects directly
into files. This makes the input and output targets of the serialization framework more flexible.

### SQL

The standard for `Actor` access to relational databases in `otavia` references the JDBC design.

### Logger

SLF4A is the logging standard in `otavia` and references the design of SLF4J. You can get a `Logger` with the following
code

```scala
Logger.getLogger(getClass, system)
```

However, there is already a `Logger` property within `StateActor` and `ChannelsActor` that developers can use directly.
